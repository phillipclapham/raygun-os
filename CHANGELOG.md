## [7.0] - January 2026

**The Coherence Update** - Major restructure for coherence and teachability.

### Changed
- Reorganized from 6 fragmented parts to 4 coherent parts organized by reader journey:
  1. Understanding (Gap, Model, Why It Works)
  2. Practicing (Core Operation, Two Pathways, Implementation, Troubleshooting)
  3. Deepening (Advanced States, Self as Frame, Stage Progression, Applications)
  4. Meaning (Paradox, Frame War, Theoretical Foundations)
- Reduced from ~4100 lines to ~2730 lines (leaner, same content, better organized)

### Added
- **Two Pathways model** (cognitive vs felt) for frame selection
- **"The Felt Dimension"** as organizing principle for practice
- Named "mischief" as the specific felt quality powering mad scientist stance
- Reference section with consolidated Evidence Confidence Levels
- Clear reader progression with each part building on previous

### Consolidated
- 17 scattered technique teachings unified into Practice section
- All troubleshooting content unified into single coherent section
- All advanced content unified into Stage Progression and Advanced Applications
- Eliminated orphan sections (Energy States, Cold Start, Red Flags, Meta-Game, Harvest, Frame War, Active Inference now properly integrated)
