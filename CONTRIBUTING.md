# Contributing to RAYGUN OS

RAYGUN OS evolves based on actual practice and evidence, not committee design.

---

## Contributions Welcome

If you've:
- Used RAYGUN OS and discovered something
- Found research that validates/challenges the model
- Spotted errors or unclear sections
- Built on the architecture in interesting ways

**PRs and issues welcome.**

---

## Guidelines

**No productivity porn** - This isn't about optimization/maximization. Keep the focus on engagement, aliveness, and experimentation.

**Evidence-based** - Claims need backing (or clearly marked as hypothesis/logical extension). We're grounded in research, not mysticism.

**Mad scientist energy** - Keep the experimental substrate framing. This is about playing with reality, not grinding through tasks.

**Honest about confidence** - Mark what's PROVEN vs. SUPPORTED vs. LOGICAL EXTENSION. We don't bullshit about research backing.

**Maintain the tone** - Irreverent, direct, no corporate speak. "You're a mad scientist, not a productivity machine."

## Types of Contributions

**Research additions:**
- New studies supporting existing claims
- Research challenging parts of the model
- Better ways to frame the evidence

**Clarity improvements:**
- Making complex sections more accessible
- Fixing unclear explanations
- Adding examples that illuminate concepts

**Extensions:**
- New implementation approaches that fit the model
- Practical applications you've discovered
- Integrations with other evidence-based systems

**Corrections:**
- Factual errors
- Misrepresented research
- Broken links or references

## Review Timing

This is a personal practice document shared publicly. PRs reviewed **when energy allows, not on a schedule.**

That's not rejection - it's practicing what the system preaches (fascination over grinding).

If you need faster feedback or want to take this in a different direction, **fork and evolve your own version.** That's the point. The architecture is CC BY 4.0 for a reason.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Make your changes** (follow guidelines above)
3. **Submit a PR** with clear description of what and why
4. **Be patient** - review happens when fascination and energy align

## What Gets Merged

Changes that:
- Improve clarity without changing meaning
- Add solid research backing
- Fix errors or broken references
- Extend the model in evidence-based ways
- Maintain the mad scientist energy and anti-productivity framing

Changes that probably won't:
- Add productivity/optimization language
- Make claims without research backing
- Shift tone toward corporate/self-help
- Remove honesty about research confidence levels

## Questions?

Open an issue for discussion. No guarantee of response time, but we'll get there.
